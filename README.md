# The mini Mighty Grid! #

**mini Mighty Grid is 4 grids in one. And all at an overhead of only 2.4k, minified, without the demo styles. And only 51 (fifty-one!) bytes if you don't need a columns grid.**

- Simple Grid: Modern, simplified CSS Grid
- Columns Grid: Responsive-columns, float grid
- Percentage Grid: Responsive, percentage-based, float grid
- Floating Point Grid: Responsive, floating point, float grid

**Why four grids?**

Because designers do crazy things. And crazy things don't always fit into a single grid solution. Not only do each of these grids solve a unique problem, but they can all be used together -- even nested!

## Requires ##

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), CSS extension language.

Note: If you just want all the grids with the default breakpoints (0, 480, 768, 960, 1200) and don't want to compile sass, you can download the `/css/layout.min.css` file and be on your way. Or if you don't need a columns grid at all you can do the same for `/css/layout-no-cols.min.css`.

## How To Use ##

You have a choice of 4 different grids. As-is, all are enabled. You can use any one, or any combination of grids together. You can even nest different grids.

Just edit the main `/scss/layout.scss` file to include or remove the components you want. Simple Grid, Percentage Grid and Floating Point Grid all work without any additional includes. But the Columns Grid requires the `/scss/_columns-grid-settings.scss` file to be included.


## The Grids ##

### Simple Grid (css grid) ###

A very basic grid for very basic grid needs. Intended to be a modern replacement for float grids. This implementation of a CSS Grid uses only a small portion of the full range of what CSS Grids are capable of. If you need something more you should create your own custom grid or use this as a jumping off point.

To include the Simple Grid, just include the mixin in your html container element.

Example: `.grid-container {@include simple-grid(1fr 1fr 1fr, auto, 5px, 1em, 768px);}`

Simple Grid takes 5 arguements:
- $cols    Columns, can be any value 'grid-template-columns' accepts. Default: 1fr
- $rows    Rows, can be any value 'grid-auto-rows' allows. Default: auto
                NOTE: 'auto' will cause all cells, in all rows, to be equal height
- $gutter  Gutter, can be any value 'gap' allows. Default: 1rem
- $margin  Margin, the outer margin of the grid. Can be any value(s) 'margin' accepts. Default: 0
- $width   Max-width, can be any value 'max-width' allows. Default: 100%

**HTML Usage**

```
<article class="grid-container">
    <div>
        <p>
            At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.
        </p>
    </div>
</article>
```

### Columns Grid ###

The columns grid is a classic float grid. It uses rows and columns to create a basic grid layout.

To use it you will need to also include the `/scss/_columns-grid-settings.scss`. In the settings file you can create your breakpoints as well as define the number of columns for the grid.



**HTML Usage**

This example would render 1 column for 0 pixels up to medium resolution and 2 columns from medium resolution and above.

```
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            ...content here...
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            ...content here...
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Percentage Grid ###

Unlike the column based grid, the percentage grid doesn't use breakpoints. Instead you must define special classes in your scss/css files and use a special sass function to set the columns widths.

This example would render a row with the first column 25% width and the second column 75% width.

Note the name of the sass function is colp().

**The HTML**
```
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column-a">
            ...content here...
        </div>
        <div class="column-b">
            ...content here...
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

**The sass/css**
```
.column-a {
    @include colp(.25);
}
.column-b {
    @include colp(.75);
}
```

### Floating Point Grid ###

The floating point grid works almost exactly like the percentage grid with two exceptions. The widths are expressed in floating point numbers that equal 100% of the total units given and the sass function receives 2 variables. The floating point number and total units.

This example would render a row with the first column 2.4 units out of 7 units wide and the second column 4.6 units out of 7 units wide (2.4 + 4.6 = 7 or 100%). You can use any set of units you like as long as the end result is 100% of the 2nd variable.

Note the name of the sass function is `colu()`.

**The HTML**
```
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column-a">
            ...content here...
        </div>
        <div class="column-b">
            ...content here...
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

**The sass/css**
```
.column-a {
    @include colu(2.4, 7);
}
.column-b {
    @include colu(4.6, 7);
}
```
